My interest is in pursuing Behavioral Data Science, analyzing and drawing meaningful conclusions about human behaviors from data. I have and am currently taking relevant coursework such as Foundations of Psychological Data Science I and II (FDS1, FDS2) using Python and Elements of Data Science course using R.
