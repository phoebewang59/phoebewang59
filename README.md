# Phoebe Wang
I am a Junior Psychology student with an Applied Statistical Modeling Certificate and a Business Minor at UT Austin. 

My interest is in pursuing Behavioral Data Science, and I have and am currently taking relevant coursework such as Psychological Data Science I and II. 

The repository titled "Phoebe's Homework" shows the assignments that I have worked on in the Foundations of Psychological Data Science I course. It also includes a final project that I have worked on, demonstrating my data wrangling and visualization skills.
