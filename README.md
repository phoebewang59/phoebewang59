# Feng Chun (Phoebe) Wang

Hi! I'm Phoebe, a senior at UT Austin majoring in Behavioral and Social Data Science, with an Applied Statistical Modeling Certificate and a Business minor.

My interests lie at the intersection of machine learning, statistical modeling, and human behavior. I enjoy building data-driven analyses and models that uncover behavioral patterns in real-world systems — from online mental health communities to human–computer interaction and risk analysis.

**Selected Areas of Work:**
- Machine learning for risk prediction (SVM, feature selection, model evaluation)
- Network and sentiment analysis of online communities  
- Motion-tracking and behavioral kinematics using the Leap Motion Controller  
- Large-scale EDA and data visualization  
- Applied statistics for human behavior research  

**Programming & Tools:**  
Python (pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, matplotlib), R (tidyverse, igraph, sentimentr), SQL, Flask, GitHub, Jupyter Notebook

**Highlighted Projects:**  
- Reddit mental health sentiment + network analysis  
- Diabetes risk factor ML classification  
- NYC motor vehicle crash analysis  
- Leap Motion hand-tracking and kinematic feature extraction
