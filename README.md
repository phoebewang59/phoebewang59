I am a Junior Psychology student with an Applied Statistical Modeling Certificate and a Business Minor at UT Austin. 

My interest is in pursuing Behavioral Data Science, I am an international student from Taiwan, and I came to the US just for college. I am interested in psychology and data science, which is why I decided to take this course to fulfill my upper-division requirements.
